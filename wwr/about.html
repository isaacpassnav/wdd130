                <p>Rafting, that thrilling activity that challenges turbulent waters, has its roots in the human need to
                    explore the unknown and conquer the wild. It dates back to ancient times when civilizations relied
                    on rivers for trade, agriculture, and survival.

                    The history of modern rafting traces back to the picturesque mountain regions of North America,
                    where brave explorers and pioneers ventured into the rapids of unknown rivers. In the 1970s, rafting
                    emerged as a recreational activity, attracting intrepid adventurers in search of excitement and
                    camaraderie amidst the wild.</p>
                <img class="img-history" src="images/rafting4.jpg" alt="History">
                <p>Since then, rafting has evolved into an exhilarating sport and a popular form of outdoor adventure
                    worldwide. Today, people of all ages and abilities can enjoy the thrilling challenge of paddling
                    through tumultuous rapids, surrounded by stunning landscapes and the thrill of rushing water.

                    At our rafting center, we take pride in being part of this passionate history. With expert guides,
                    high-quality gear, and a commitment to safety and fun, we invite you to join us on an adventure that
